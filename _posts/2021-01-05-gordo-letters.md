bio: Hailing from Portugal, tattooing since 2008, Gordo learned his craft the
  old school way. A traditional apprentice at a traditional tattoo shop. Being
  heavily influenced by hip hop and graffiti culture his style evolved into a
  unique, beautiful and pioneering form of calligraphy finessed through years of
  extensive travel. Working at some of the most prestigious shops around the
  world we are honoured to have him as a regular guest at OHFY. Gordo is
  currently mainly focused on large scale projects but please feel free to
  contact him directly for any queries – gordoletters@gmail.com
