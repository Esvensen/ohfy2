          <p>
            Please just come by yourself. Our studio isn't huge so any extra
            bodies in the space does make it quite uncomfortable for everyone.
            If you require someone for support or any reason please do let us
            know in advance so we can prepare and accommodate accordingly.

          <p>Just be respectful, it is not a lot to ask!</p>
          <p>
            Make sure that you bring snacks and anything else you need for your
            session (ie: towel for full bodysuits / large pieces, loose
            clothing, preferably NOT white as it might get stained and Tattoo
            Ink does not wash off) We recommend bringing a sugary drink and
            snack to keep your blood sugar up whilst being tattooed.

            If you require extra privacy please let us know in advance, your
